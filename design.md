## System Overview

### Purpose

To create a robust Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of processing user queries on the Discord platform, leveraging a PostgreSQL-PGVector database, and utilizing a powerful large language model.

### Key Features

- Efficient Query Processing: Quickly processes user queries from Discord.
- Relevant Document Retrieval: Retrieves pertinent documents from a knowledge base.
- Contextual Response Generation: Generates contextually relevant responses using a powerful language model.
- Scalable Infrastructure: Leverages a microservices architecture and cloud-native technologies for scalability and reliability.
- Robust Security: Implements security best practices to protect user data and system integrity.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL-PGVector, GraphQL
- Frontend: React, Redux, TypeScript
- Infrastructure: Docker

### Microservices

Here are the design specifications of the microservices within this project.

1. API Gateway

  - Handles incoming requests (e.g. GraphQL) and routes them to appropriate services.
  - Implements authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

2. Server

  - Indexes documents, creates embeddings, and performs similarity search.
  - Stores embeddings and metadata in PostgreSQL-PGVector.

3. Ollama Service

  - Interacts with the LLM (e.g. llama3.2) to embed and generate text.

4. Discord Service

  - Interacts with the Discord API (discord.js) to receive and send messages.

5. Frontend

  - Provides a web-based interface for viewing server statistics and interacting with the application.

6. Database Service

  - Stores all of the projects information.

### Database

- PostgreSQL-PGVector: Stores structured data, embeddings, and metadata.

## Infrastructure

- Containerization: Use Docker to package each service into containers.
- Orchestration: Use Kubernetes to manage and deploy containers.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing with GitHub Actions.

## Testing

- Unit Testing: Test individual components in isolation.
- Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different components.
